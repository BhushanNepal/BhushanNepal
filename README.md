## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Bhushan Nepal

About me
Being good at math in school naturally led me toward engineering, which is why Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IOE Pulchowk Campus. Originally from Jhapa, Nepal, I completed my schooling at Dhulabari Secondary School. While I sometimes feel that choosing engineering was my worst decision, it has also opened doors for me to explore new interests, especially Data Science, where Iâ€™m building practical skills for future opportunities. I believe in living a simple and happy life, and the process of learning new things keeps me motivated despite the challenges.
